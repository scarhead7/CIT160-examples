# CIT160-examples
Examples of code for my CIT160 class. It will have simple C and JavaScript examples.


## My fellow class-mates!
In order to preserve the integrity of this class, please only view the code once you have made sufficient efforts to write it on your own. I have provided--in most cases--screenshots and executables (currently only for Cygwin, but Unix executables will be coming soon) to help show how the output/input should look.
